          <h2>Who is Bernie Sanders?</h2>
          <p>Bernie Sanders born in September 8, 1941 is a junior Senator of Vermont ever since 2007. Being the longest serving individual politician not affiliated to any party, Bernie Sanders announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president on April 30, 2015, in an address on the Capitol lawn. Sanders unlike others stated soonafter his announcement that he would not pursue funding through a Super PAC, instead focusing on small individual donations. As such with his plan of not funding his candidacy with the money of "billionares" and his socialist ideologies Sanders has managed to win the hearts of many.</p>

          <h2>Ideologies</h2>
          <p>
            Sanders being a democratic socialist and a progressive is a strong admirer of the Nordic Model of social democracy and serves as a proponent of workplace democracy. Sanders as such focuses on economic issues including but not limited to  income and wealth inequality, raising the minimum wage, universal healthcare, reducing the burden of student debt, making public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions, and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000. Additionally he is a supporter of the idea of taking bold actions to reverse global warming and substantial investment in infrastructure, with "energy efficiency and sustainability" and job creation as prominent goals.

          <h2>Why Vote for Sanders?</h2>
          <p>
            Sanders, with his self-funded campaign, should be supported, as many point out, due to his fore-mentioned progressive nature and democratic socialist ideologies. Being a supporter of LGBTQ rights since the early 1980s, Sanders supporting the middle and lower class wants to break out big banks that caused the great reccession. Voting against the war in Iraq, another reason to vote for Bernie Sanders is his plan for Universal Healthcare and Free College for All, in addition to his plans of environmental conservation.

          <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>
          <p>To contribute to Bernie Sanders campaign, one can do work as simple as volunteering and even donating money (since the campaign runs entirely on contribution this would ammount to quite a lot of help). Additionally one can also help by supporting pro-Bernie organizations and spreading the word to attract more potential voters.</p>
