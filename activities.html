            <h3> Adventure Activities in Nepal </h3>
            <div class = "highlight">Trekking</div>
            <p> Trekking is still the most popular sport among visitors. The geographical and natural diversity and a range of exotic culture make Nepal an ideal place for trekking. Trek to the Himalayas of Nepal provides an opportunity to observe the culture and enjoy the beauty of nature. White water rafting on Himalayan Rivers across the typical cross section of Nepal’s geography is equally popular. You can coast on clam jade waters with splendid view all around or rush through roaring rapids. Rafting is inarguably the best way of exploring Nepal, as it takes you through hamlets, canyons, virgin forests, and wildlife. </p>
            <div class = "highlight">Jungle Safari</div>
            <p> Jungle Safari in the Terai is preferred to see Nepal’s rare varieties of animals and birds. A venture into the lush green forest on an Elephant’s back in the Terai region crossing rivers and swamps will give an opportunity to explore Flora and Fauna of Nepal as well as encounter rare animals and birds. Be prepared for a royal treat because Royal Bengal tiger may surprise you by his majestic appearance. </p>
            <div class = "highlight">Mountain Biking</div>
            <p> Since Nepal has diverse terrain, Mountain biking is another wonderful adventure sport. It offers environmentally sound way to explore the magnificent landscape and vibrant culture as well as remarkable heritage. Peddling on the hidden trails of the rarely visited rural villages, you will see smiling local faces living simple life in peace and harmony and practicing their own culture as well as speaking their own dialect. </p>
            <div class = "highlight">Other Activities</div>
            <p> Similarly you can have another thrilling experience of ultimate bungy jumping over the 160m high bridge of Bhote Koshi, one of the world’s wildest raging river rushes down from the Himalayas. Simultaneously Nepal offers other adventure activities like Bird watching, Cannoning, Mountain Expedition, Rock Climbing, Peak Climbing, Horseback Riding, Snowboarding, Fishing and even Honey Hunting. </p>
